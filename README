This is a coding challenge.


DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------
Every December my friends do a "Secret Santa" - the traditional gift exchange where everybody is randomly assigned to give a gift to a friend. To make things exciting, the matching is all random (you cannot pick your gift recipient) and nobody knows who got assigned to who until the day when the gifts are exchanged - hence, the "secret" in the name.

Since we're a big group with many couples and families, often a husband gets his wife as secret santa (or vice-versa), or a father is assigned to one of his children. 

To fix this, you must design a program that randomly assigns the Secret Santa gift exchange, but prevents people from the same family to be assigned to each other.
